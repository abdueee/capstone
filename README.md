# ASL to Speech Converter

## Overview

The ASL to Speech Converter is a capstone project aimed at bridging communication gaps between the Deaf/Mute community and the wider population. This project focuses on converting American Sign Language (ASL) gestures into written speech, allowing for seamless communication between individuals who use ASL and those who may not be familiar with sign language.

## Project Features

- **ASL Gesture Recognition:** The system recognizes and interprets ASL gestures using computer vision techniques.
- **Speech Synthesis:** Translates the recognized gestures into written speech, enabling communication with individuals who do not understand ASL.
- **Real-time Interaction:** The application supports real-time interaction, providing immediate feedback for smooth communication.
